## üßæ Contribution Guidelines

Since we all are already have local copies of the project, we can all follow these steps:

1. Firstly pull recent changes from main while still on the main branch 

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main

```

2. Checkout to your dev branch following the proper name conventions 

```bash
git checkout branch/name #if it already exists

or 

git checkout -b branch/name #if you're creating a new branch 
```

3. You can make your changes, stage(git add) and commit 

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "a good commit message"

```

4. When you‚Äôre ready to push to remote branch, firstly pull from the main branch into your own branch to be up to date.

It‚Äôs important you sync your branch with main before pushing - If not you might not be able to merge your PR 

```bash
git fetch origin
git pull origin main 
```

5. Finally push to your remote branch and raise a PR

```bash
git push origin branch/name 
```
